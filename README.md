# Advanced Graphics - Final assignment

## Description

Simple 3D graphics library that renders shapes in the console that can be moved in the world by the user.
At the start of the execution 10 shapes are spawned randomly in the world.
At any given time the user can change the shape he controls.
There are two modes: third and first person mode.
- In third person mode the camera is fixed at the origin and the user can watch the object he selected move.
- In first person mode the camera shares the transform with the object, so the user can see the world from the object's perspective.

## Controls

- **WASD**: move and rotate
- **TG**: move up and down
- **0 - 9**: change the object currently selected
- **SPACEBAR**: switch between first and third person mode
